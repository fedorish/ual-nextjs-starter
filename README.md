**This is a work in progress.**

This is a starter for a Next.js website with integration of the [WAX-blockchain](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/).

* TypeScript
* Tailwind
  


To get started.
`yarn && yarn dev` or, `npm install && npm run dev`

Environment variables are set up to connect to the WAX-testnet in development, and to the mainnet in production.
